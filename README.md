A small JavaFX application created during a midterm project. 

The user can spawn a variable amount of positively and negatively charged particles, which will then attract or repel one another depending on the charge
.
The "walls" of the application can be either toggled between solid or let through. Which will either make the particles bounce of the walls, or let them fly through them. 

Additionally a "gravitron" or attractor can be placed on the canvas which attracts all the particles in the scene.
The gravitron can be moved around via drag.
